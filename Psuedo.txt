IDEAS (not necessary to complete project, just nice to have):
1. have a "one of everything" option that shows we do have 12 items
2. have second window produce additional toppings so that console doesn't get flooded(?)
	- auto close when requested items selected
3. QA (Quality Assurance)! - How could it break, where are holes, and how to patch/prevent?
4. Customer (class) account details: rewards, loyalty, 
5. Confirm decimal price is to hundredth place (= $X.xx)
6. @2130, solve merge conflicts
7. multiple txt files for items/properties?
	- flavors, price
8. use case for menu selection to use different menu txt file
9. Console & recepit formatting - pretty!
